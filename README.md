# Interviewing

Whether you are interviewing for a software engineering position or interviewing to get into a bootcamp, both processes require technical ability. But technical ability is not the only skill that employers/bootcamps look for in a potential candidate. As individuals, we tend to focus on our hard skills at the expense of soft skills. While hard skills show whether you are qualified for a job/bootcamp, your soft skills show whether you are suited for a job, workplace or bootcamp. 

  Important Soft Skills:

  * Critical Thinking
  * Communication
  * Listening
  * Adaptability
  * Positive Attitude
  * Great Work Ethic


This sprint is focused on practicing some the important soft skills that are listed above which will put you in a better position to interview for Telegraph Academy. You, along with your pair, will take turns interviewing one another for 60 minutes total. You will take turns being the interviewer and the interviewee for 25 minutes each with 5 minutes of feedback time which brings it to 30 minutes for each individual.

##Interviewer:
  * Choose the algorithm
  * Explain the algorithm to the interviewee
  * Help the interviewee by being Stack-Overflow or Google should they have questions
  * Guide the interviewee, DO NOT GIVE THE ANSWER!
  * Question the interviewee's logic/approach (Well, why did you decide to approach the problem this way?)


## Interviewee:
  * Listen to the interviewer
  * Understand the problem
  * Ask questions!
  * Communicate like an engineer
  * Think through the problem logically
  * Provide the most MVP (Minimum Viable Product) solution first.
